Handle promotion input from python and in python
Threefold repetition
Fivefold repetition
Insufficient material
if there is one or no available opening move, no need to call minimax on it
If in the early game, use the book opening for minimax 
If in the late game(3-5 pieces total), use the endgame tablebase
Alpha-beta pruning minimax that cuts off the search at a given depth
Search depth should be dependent on the game mode
Also cut off at the repeated states and keep track of repeated states in a tranposition table
Do not cut off at the quiescent states, make a quiescent search function to handle this 
Do more research on the horizon effect
Since alpha-beta pruning is affected by the position of the generated states, make a function that sorts the states in the order of attacking to not attacking 
Allow the user to go back to the previous state
Terminal state: checkmate, stalemate, Insufficient material
